`vcgencmd` provides a way to interact with the vcgencmd utility included in Raspian.

As of yet, not all vcgencmd commands have a binding. To see which commands are missing, take a look at PROGRESS.md in the projects repo.

## Installation

Install from [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/vcgencmd):

```toml
[dependencies]
vcgencmd = "0.2.0"
```

Serialization and deserialization for the few structs this crate contains are supported via a `serde` feature flag:
```toml
[dependencies]
vcgencmd = {version: "0.2.0", features = ["serde"]
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use vcgencmd::{measure_temp, get_throttle};
```
